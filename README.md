### Improvement
A lot of things are to review on the frontend. The structure, the design, the integration of the marketplace and of the different element that I have in my Smart Contract.
I definitely had a lack of time for this exercice but it's part of the game. I accept it and I am also really glad of this experience of hard coding.
I hope that the time I spent on this project is visible. I don't regret anything !!

Thanks a lot for reading me and correct my work.
